This library contains most of the core functionality for [Bot Builder](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/tree/master/libraries/botbuilder),
but without any dependency on Node. As a result, this version can be used to build bots that run complete in a browser.

Unless you are building a bot or component _without Node_, we recommend that you `botbuilder` your app
instead of `botbuilder-core`. [Learn more here.](https://github.com/Microsoft/botbuilder-js/tree/master/libraries/botbuilder/README.md)

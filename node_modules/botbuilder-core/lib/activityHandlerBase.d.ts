/**
 * Defines the core behavior for event-emitting activity handlers for bots.
 *
 * @remarks
 * This provides an extensible class for handling incoming activities in an event-driven way.
 * You can register an arbitrary set of handlers for each event type.
 *
 * To register a handler for an event, use the corresponding _on event_ method. If multiple handlers are
 * registered for an event, they are run in the order in which they were registered.
 *
 * This object emits a series of _events_ as it processes an incoming activity.
 * A handler can stop the propagation of the event by not calling the continuation function.
 *
 * | Event type | Description |
 * | :--- | :--- |
 * | Type-specific | Emitted for the specific activity type, before emitting an event for any sub-type. |
 * | Sub-type | Emitted for certain specialized events, based on activity content. |
 *
 * **See also**
 * - The [Bot Framework Activity schema](https://aka.ms/botSpecs-activitySchema)

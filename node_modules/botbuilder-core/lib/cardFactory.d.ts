 *
 * This example sends a message that contains a single hero card.

 * const card = CardFactory.heroCard(
 *      'White T-Shirt',

     * Returns an attachment for an Adaptive Card.
     *
     * @param card A description of the Adaptive Card to return.
     *
     * @remarks
     * Adaptive Cards are an open card exchange format enabling developers to exchange UI content in a common and consistent way.
     * For channels that don't yet support Adaptive Cards natively, the Bot Framework will
     * down-render the card to an image that's been styled to look good on the target channel. For
     * channels that support [hero cards](#herocards) you can continue to include Adaptive Card
     * actions and they will be sent as buttons along with the rendered version of the card.
     *
     * For more information about Adaptive Cards and to download the latest SDK, visit
     * [adaptivecards.io](http://adaptivecards.io/).
     *
     * For example:
     * ```JavaScript
     * const card = CardFactory.adaptiveCard({
     *   "$schema": "http://adaptivecards.io/schemas/adaptive-card.json",
     *   "type": "AdaptiveCard",

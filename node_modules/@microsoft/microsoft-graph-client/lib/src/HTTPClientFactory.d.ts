     * 		* TelemetryHandler should be the one prior to the last middleware in the chain, because this is the one which actually collects and appends the usage flag and placing this handler 	*		  before making the actual network call ensures that the usage of all features are recorded in the flag.
     * 		* The best place for AuthenticationHandler is in the starting of the pipeline, because every other handler might have to work for multiple times for a request but the auth token for
     * 		  them will remain same. For example, Retry and Redirect handlers might be working multiple times for a request based on the response but their auth token would remain same.

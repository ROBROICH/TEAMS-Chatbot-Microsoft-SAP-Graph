 *
 * @remarks
 * The bot adapter encapsulates authentication processes and sends activities to and receives
 * activities from the Bot Connector Service. When your bot receives an activity, the adapter
 * creates a turn context object, passes it to your bot application logic, and sends responses
 * back to the user's channel.
 *
 * The adapter processes and directs incoming activities in through the bot middleware pipeline to
 * your bot logic and then back out again. As each activity flows in and out of the bot, each
 * piece of middleware can inspect or act upon the activity, both before and after the bot logic runs.
 * Use the [use](xref:botbuilder-core.BotAdapter.use) method to add [Middleware](xref:botbuilder-core.Middleware)
 * objects to your adapter's middleware collection.
 *

 * [How bots work](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-basics) and
 * [Middleware](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-concept-middleware).

 *
 * const adapter = new BotFrameworkAdapter({

     *
     * @remarks
     * This is often referred to as a _proactive notification_, the bot can proactively
     * send a message to a conversation or user without waiting for an incoming message.
     * For example, a bot can use this method to send notifications or coupons to a user.
     *
     * To send a proactive message:
     * 1. Save a copy of a [ConversationReference](xref:botframework-schema.ConversationReference)
     *    from an incoming activity. For example, you can store the conversation reference in a database.
     * 1. Call this method to resume the conversation at a later time. Use the saved reference to access the conversation.
     * 1. On success, the adapter generates a [TurnContext](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext) object and calls the `logic` function handler.
     *    Use the `logic` function to send the proactive message.
     *
     * To copy the reference from any incoming activity in the conversation, use the
     * [TurnContext.getConversationReference](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext.getConversationReference) method.
     *
     * This method is similar to the [processActivity](xref:botbuilder.BotFrameworkAdapter.processActivity) method.

     * To use this method, you need both the bot's and the user's account information on a channel.
     * The Bot Connector service supports the creating of group conversations; however, this
     * method and most channels only support initiating a direct message (non-group) conversation.
     *
     * To create and start a new conversation:
     * 1. Get a copy of a [ConversationReference](xref:botframework-schema.ConversationReference) from an incoming activity.
     * 1. Set the [user](xref:botframework-schema.ConversationReference.user) property to the
     *    [ChannelAccount](xref:botframework-schema.ChannelAccount) value for the intended recipient.
     * 1. Call this method to request that the channel create a new conversation with the specified user.
     * 1. On success, the adapter generates a turn context and calls the `logic` function handler.
     *
     * To get the initial reference, use the
     * [TurnContext.getConversationReference](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext.getConversationReference)
     * method on any incoming activity in the conversation.
     *
     * If the channel establishes the conversation, the generated event activity's
     * [conversation](xref:botframework-schema.Activity.conversation) property will contain the
     * ID of the new conversation.
     *
     * This method is similar to the [processActivity](xref:botbuilder.BotFrameworkAdapter.processActivity) method.

     *      server, using the bot's `appId` and `appPassword`. The request is rejected if the sender's
     *      identity is not verified.
     * 1. Creates a [TurnContext](xref:botbuilder-core.TurnContext) object for the received activity.

     *    - When this method completes, the proxy is revoked.
     * 1. Sends the turn context through the adapter's middleware pipeline.
     * 1. Sends the turn context to the `logic` function.
     *    - The bot may perform additional routing or processing at this time.
     *      Returning a promise (or providing an `async` handler) will cause the adapter to wait for any asynchronous operations to complete.
     *    - After the `logic` function completes, the promise chain set up by the middleware is resolved.
     *
     * > [!TIP]
     * > If you see the error `TypeError: Cannot perform 'set' on a proxy that has been revoked`
     * > in your bot's console output, the likely cause is that an async function was used
     * > without using the `await` keyword. Make sure all async functions use await!
